# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to complete Bobby's manager's additional assignments:
* Determine the number of retiring employees per title

## Summary

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Retirement-ready employees make up 24.15% of the company's total number of employees. To maintain the same employee population, a maximum of 72,458 positions will need to be filled by 72,458 new hires. This number will be fewer if a smaller percent of retirement-ready employees decide to retire.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

There are 1,549 employees eligible for mentorship, and 72,458 retirement-ready employees. However, in order for each mentorship-eligible employee to have a qualified mentor within their own department, additional exploration is needed. Here we find the ratio of Retirement-ready employees to employees eligible for mentorship for each department:

`SELECT m.dept_name, m.mentees, r.retirees, r.retirees/m.mentees AS retiree_to_mentee_ratio
FROM (
    SELECT d.dept_name, COUNT(de.emp_no) AS mentees
    FROM dept_emp as de
    INNER JOIN departments as d
    ON de.dept_no = d.dept_no
    INNER JOIN mentorship_eligibility as me
    ON de.emp_no = me.emp_no
    WHERE me.to_date = '9999-01-01'
    GROUP BY d.dept_name
) AS m
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT d.dept_name, COUNT(de.emp_no) AS retirees
    FROM dept_emp as de
    INNER JOIN departments as d
    ON de.dept_no = d.dept_no
    INNER JOIN retirement_info as ri
    ON de.emp_no = ri.emp_no
    GROUP BY d.dept_name
) AS r
ON m.dept_name = r.dept_name;`
